                <h1 id="microservicesorchestrationwitheventstreams">Microservices orchestration with event streams</h1>
<p><hr>
<br></p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to attend
<a href="https://twitter.com/fgeorge52?lang=en">Fred George</a>'s talk
"<em>IoT and MicroServices in the Home</em>" at
<a href="http://nights.yowconference.com.au/">YOW! Nights</a>. The talk is available on
<a href="https://youtu.be/J1eTutzcGFQ">YouTube</a> and it's strongly recommended! Another
similar talk is <a href="https://twitter.com/perrynfowler">Perryn Fowler</a>'s
"<em>Microservices and IoT: A Perfect Match</em>", also available on
<a href="https://youtu.be/Am7edhP6G7s">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>These talks are somehow similar and describe the use of event streams to
orchestrate several microservices that monitor and control some IoT devices
such as lights and sensors.</p>
<p>I found the topic very interesting, and I wanted to try this type of architecture
myself. The systems presented in the aforementioned talks are based on real-time
data processing, and I want to figure out whether this approach can be also
used for other use cases.</p>
<h1 id="edisoncars">Edison Cars</h1>
<p><em>Edison Cars</em> is an hypothetical manufacturer of electric vehicles that wants
to sell its products online. The newly born company has a shiny state-of-the-art
UI that collects orders from customers and communicates such information to the
other departments of the company, such as the warehouse, the assembly lines and
so forth and so on. There are several ways to implement an IT infrastructure
capable to support such business model.</p>
<h2 id="monolith">Monolith</h2>
<p>Well. No. ðŸ˜¬</p>
<h2 id="synchronousrestfulservices">Synchronous RESTful Services</h2>
<p>A first approach consist in the implementation of several microservices, one for
each division of the company. As soon as a customer buys a new car, the sales
service stores a new record in its DB, and then it invokes all the services
required to "<em>implement</em>" the sale. Such approach is known as <em>services
orchestration</em>. Soon enough we will find out that the sales app is required to
<em>know too much</em>: it has to know which are the services required, how to invoke
them, and eventually in which order.</p>
<h2 id="queues">Queues</h2>
<p>Another solution consists in the use of queues, such as
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">SQS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chanks/que">Que</a> or
similar. With this implementation, the sole responsibility of the sales app is
to (<em>sell a car and</em>) enqueue the data about the sale. Such information is then
retrieved and processed by workers in the other services. Usually a
queue works for a single consumer, which removes the job from the queue. Therefore,
this is not an ideal solution if we need to share the same information
between several services, unless we instanciate a queue for each required service
and we enqueue the same information over and over again.</p>
<p>The sales app is still required to know about other services, in the form of
queues, but through this architecture it is not required to know <em>how</em> to invoke
such services Its sole responsibility now is to post a message to a queue.
The overall system is also more fault-tolerant, because it will keep working even
if one of the other services is down. With services orchestration, the downtime
of one of the services affects the sales app, because it is not able to communicate
with the other apps required to complete the sale. In this new model, the sales
app can complete the sale as soon as it publishes the message to the queue. Once
the faulty service is up and running again, it will simply subscribe to the queue
again and process the remaining job, without blocking the entire business.</p>
<h2 id="datafeeds">Data Feeds</h2>
<p>To make the sales app completely independent from other services, we can
introduce a data feed. A data feed is a JSON/XML representation
of one or more entities stored in the DB (<em>e.g. orders</em>) that can be consumed
by other services. Such services periodically check the feed for updates and
create a local copy of such data in their local DB. In this scenario, a
warehouse app can check the feed and order new pieces when it detects a new
order, a dashboard app can update its statistics and so son.</p>
<p>The sales app now is not required to know about other systems at all, new
services can be easilly added and removed, and the overall architecture is still
very fault-tolerant. In this scenario, even the downtime of a source of information
won't affect the whole system. Let's say there's a customer app, which stores
the information required for the billing and the shipment. Even if this app is
down for some reason, the fault won't affect hypothetical billing and shipping
apps, because they hold a copy of the customers information in their local DB.</p>
<p>This solution works well when data is not updated often and the local copy is
good enough to continue operations. On the other hand, we are stressing source
apps (<em>e.g. sales, customers, etc.</em>) which are accessed often to provide fresh
data. This can potentially slow down the app when there are many downstream
systems and/or the feed is particularly heavy.</p>
<h2 id="eventstreams">Event Streams</h2>
<p>With an event stream, the sales app is required to pubilsh the sale event and
the relative data to a message broker. Downstream systems subscribe to the event
stream and get notified every time there is a new event. The advantages are the
same of the Data Feed solution, but we have added an extra layer between the data
source and its consumers. The message broker is an external system, therefore
the sales app is not queried constantly. Consumer systems read directly from the
stream and store the data locally, achievieng the same decoupling and resiliency
goals. Is this the silver bullet then? Can I use it for any use case?</p>
<h1 id="rabbitmqhandson">RabbitMQ Hands-on</h1>
<p>I've tried to build the microservices for <em>Edison Cars</em> using
<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, as suggested by Fred George in his talk.
The source code of my little project is available on <a href="https://github.com/Kalimaha/event-stream-playground">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For each new order in the sales app, a new record is stored in the DB, and the
event is published on the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-ruby.html">exchange</a>.
Basically, an exchange is an object that receives messages and pushes them to
queues:</p>
<pre><code>def publish(order:)
  connection  = open_connection
  channel     = connection.create_channel
  exchange    = channel.fanout('orders', :durable =&gt; true)
  message     = create_message(order)

  exchange.publish(message, :persistent =&gt; true)

  connection.close
end
</code></pre>
