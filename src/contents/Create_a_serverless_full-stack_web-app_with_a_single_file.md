# Create a full-stack serverless web-app with a single file
<hr>
<br>

Serverless is one of the biggest buzzwords of these years, and the implementation of
solutions based on such architecture has been boosted by the release of
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

This post describes a little experiment
I conducted as a challenge to myself. I wanted to define and deploy a fully functional
web-app (_both back-end and front-end_) based on RESTful services in a single file.

The web-app itself is a very simple guestbook, that allows users to post short messages and
read what other users previously posted. 

# What is serverless anyway?

> Serverless can also mean applications where some amount of server-side logic is still written by the application developer but unlike traditional architectures is run in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (_may only last for one invocation_), and fully managed by a 3rd party.
